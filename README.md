# SSI CW23 Hack Day: Forge RSE Skill Development Pathways

This repository was created from a Software Sustainability Institute Collaborations Workshop 2023 Hack Day. 

The idea is to constructe a resource that is for the RSE community and curated by the RSE community. 

## About

Forge RSE Skill Development Pathways is a resource to support RSEs (Research Software Engineers) in tracking and managing their professional development. Note that, while we've focussed on RSEs for the initial hack day demonstration, this tool can be used for any roles. We plan to extend this to other research roles and welcome contributions and collaboration from anyone working in research, broadly defined.

Forge RSE comprises:

1. An RSE competency framework, outlining a structured set of skills that are useful when working as an RSE, with examples of how these skills can be demonstrated at different levels of experience. Not all RSEs will o need to have all skills at all levels.
2. A curated set of training resources, linked to the skills and levels from the competency framework.
3. A tool to visualise and compare different competency profiles.

Forge RSE aims to support the following uses:

1. Recording and visualising your competency profile as an individual RSE
2. Comparing competency profiles across a group of RSEs (e.g. to show the commonalities and variety across RSEs doing the same role at the same level at the same organisation, or comparing across organisations)
3. Find high-quality training resources to improve skills in a particular competency
4. Define aspirational competency profiles, illustrate the gap to your current profile and highlight training resources that could help bridge that gap.

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on. We are using this [git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
